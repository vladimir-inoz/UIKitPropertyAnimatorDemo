## UIKitPropertyAnimatorDemo

This project is example of using `UIViewPropertyAnimator` to create interactive and interruptible animations. The project is inspired by WWDC 2017 presentation "Advanced animations in iOS" (https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/230/) and Nathan Gitter tutorial (https://github.com/nathangitter/interactive-animations). Key difference from these projects is grouping coordination of `UIViewPropertyAnimator` in class `AnimationCoordinator`
